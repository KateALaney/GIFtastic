# GIFtastic

This project allows users to click on buttons on a pre-determined topic (fantasy movies) to generate a still GIF, and then offers the ability to click on each of the GIFs to animate them.  Users also have the ability to create buttons of their own to call new GIF topics.

The content is generated through GIPHY's API using an AJAX call.
